# Monstrous Society

## Organization of the Damned
_"There's evil stuff going on in here. And I want in."_

Supernatural creatures are in the big scheme of things rather rare. An individual Werewolf may go their entire life without ever encountering another supernatural creature (beyond of course the Werewolf that mauled them into their current state in the first place). So it's not surprising that when they _do_ find each other they tend to make exclusive clubs. These social organizations are in many ways templated on the human social organizations that the creatures that created them lived in when they mingled in human society. And with the sheer _age_ that some creatures possess, it is perhaps unsurprising that many of these organizations are in fact crazy old-fashioned.
