# Skills
_No one may ever know if what you did was good or bad, but you did it well._

A key portion of the die roll for any test is the _skill_. It represents _specific_ training that helps a character perform a task. And because of that, it can lead to a far amount of confusion among some people, because linguistically we refer both to people who are very good at something and also people who are good at a wide variety of things as being "skilled". In After Sundown, skills are basically confined to the former interpretation. Jacks of All Trades are represented game mechanically by people who have relatively high _attributes_ and low skills. People with high skills are specialists by definition.
