## Using Attributes Without Skills
_"Granted, but I'm still huge."_

Characters in After Sundown may be called upon to use skills when they don't actually have training in that area. In this case, the character is called upon to _default_ on the skill. This allows the character to roll a dicepool of their appropriate Attribute (plus zero dice for not having the skill). When defaulting on a Social or Technical Skill, the character suffers an additional -1die  penalty for being untrained. When using Technical Skills, that same -1 die penalty applies whenever the character doesn't have an appropriate specialization (even if they _do_ have the appropriate skill). But there are a number of times when you will want to do something for which _no_ skill applies. In that case a mere attribute roll may suffice (obviously with no -1 die penalty). But remember that dice pools without skills are substantially _smaller_ than dicepools with skills attached - so in most cases the MC should try to figure out a way to fit a skill in.

### Resistance Rolls
_"No one could have survived that."_

Characters who are attacked or endangered are often entitled to a Resistance Roll to soak the effects of whatever they are threatened with, whether its the power of a magical assault or a bullet to the stomach. In general, a Physical Resistance roll will usually be just Strength (no skill), a Mental Resistance roll will usually be just Intuition (again, no skill), and a Social Resistance roll will be just Willpower (likewise). Luminaries get a special bonus, where they can add their Edge to Resistance rolls, almost like Edge was the "take less damage from bullets" skill, if that makes things any easier to conceptualize.

### Sure Things: Heavy Lifting
_"Sure, sometimes you can do all kinds of stuff. But I can **always** lift a car."_

There are things you don't have to roll because they simply _are_. A character with a high Charisma _is_ charming, a character with a high Logic _is_ smart. Even if they offend someone or fail to solve a problem, they will do so in a charming or intelligent fashion. But probably the thing you will run into most frequently as far as automatic uses of Attributes is Strength. People who have a high Strength _are strong_, and they can lift heavy things. So to help out with that, here's a table of how much a character might be able to push themselves to lift up, and how much they might be able to carry home without hurting themselves.

| Strength | Max Lift (Kg) | Carry (Kg) | Max Lift (Lb) | Carry (Lb) |
|:--------:|--------------:|-----------:|--------------:|-----------:|
| 1 | 30 | 10 | 66 | 22 |
| 2 | 50 | 20 | 110 | 44 |
| 3 | 100 | 30 | 210 | 66 |
| 4 | 150 | 50 | 330 | 110 |
| 5 | 250 | 70 | 550 | 155 |
| 6 | 450 | 100 | 990 | 220 |
| 7 | 750 | 200 | 1,650 | 440 |
| 8 | 1,250 | 500 | 2,750 | 1,100 |
| 9 | 2,500 | 1,000 | 5,500 | 2,200 |
| 10 | 5,000 | 2,000 | 11,000 | 4,400 |
| 11 | 7,000 | 3,000 | 15,400 | 6,600 |
| 12 | 10,000 | 4,500 | 22,000 | 10,000 |
| 13 | 14,000 | 6,000 | 31,000 | 13,000 |
| 14 | 20,000 | 8,000 | 44,000 | 17,500 |
| 15 | 28,000 | 10,000 | 62,000 | 22,000 |
| 20 | 60,000 | 24,000 | 132,000 | 53,000 |
| 25 | 100,000 | 40,000 | 220,000 | 88,000 |
| 30 | 150,000 | 60,000 | 330,000 | 132,000 |
| 35 | 200,000 | 80,000 | 441,000 | 176,000 |

And yes, things that are really strong are _really strong_. A creature with a strength of 35 can lift a _train_ right off the track. Although they can only do this by lifting one car at a time and can't really walk off with it. Consider the scene in [King Kong](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024216/) where the giant ape (who in After Sundown would be a Kaiju) pulls a train off the tracks by lifting a car and dropping the whole thing. That's not an exaggeration, in After Sundown the giant apes can actually do those things.
