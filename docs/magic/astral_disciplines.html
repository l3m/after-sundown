<p>The mercurial rain of the Deep Maya has an origin that few can even speculate
upon. But whether The Dreamlands represent an intrusion of our subconscious
minds into the realm of the physical or the intrusion of an alien realm into our
sleeping thoughts, the fact remains that it is a source of power that those who
delve deeply into its mysteries can tap. Astral Sorceries are spells and powers
that tap into that strange reality. Magic from Maya has a tendency to be as
untamed and inhuman as the implacable beasts and plants that inhabit it.</p>
<p>Astral Sorcery disturbs magnetic fields, including that of the Earth itself (at
least on a local level), and a skilled augur can track and judge the strength of
the magics of the dreamlands by carefully observing a lodestone.  Astral magic
&quot;feels wet&quot; to those who feel its wrath, and indeed it can be countered by
judiciously throwing clean salt on it. Salt used in this manner becomes caked
and discolored like it had absorbed dirty water.</p>
<a class="header" href="#call-of-the-wild" id="call-of-the-wild"><h2>Call of the Wild</h2></a>
<p><em>&quot;Be what you want to be until you don't any more.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Call of the Wild is the sorcerous path of attuning one's self to wild animals,
hence the name. This attunement provides great benefits when dealing with
animals even in a nonmagical manner. The character gains a +2 bonus on Animal
Ken. This bonus increases to +4 with Advanced, and +6 with Elder Call of the
Wild. These bonuses are increased by 50% when dealing with creatures that the
character can personally transform into with Beast Form (so for example a
character with Beast Form (Bat) would gain a +3, +6, or +9 bonus on Animal Ken
checks to train bats).</p>
<a class="header" href="#basic-call-of-the-wild" id="basic-call-of-the-wild"><h3>Basic Call of the Wild</h3></a>
<p><strong>Beast Form</strong> The character can transform into an animal by spending a power
point and taking a Complex Action.  The type of animal transformed into is
chosen when the ability is learned. When Beast Form is gained as a fixed ability
from a character's supernatural type, the form of the beast is often predefined
(for example, a Nezumi becomes a rat). This ability can be learned multiple
times, and each time the character can choose one more new form than the time
before (two new forms with the second learning, for a total of 3). No beast form
can be much larger than a human, or smaller than a mouse. Some animals are
stronger or more agile than a human, but the total bonus to these attributes
never exceeds +2. Many animals are <em>much</em> weaker than a human. For example: a
Rat Form always has a strength reduced to 1 regardless of the original
character's Strength score, and gains a +2 bonus to Agility. This ability is a
Protean power. For purposes of being countered, Beast Form has 3 hits.</p>
<p><strong>Tongue of Beasts</strong> The character can speak to and understand the speech of
beasts. This is invaluable in training and information gathering. But remember
that animals do not gain any special understanding of their environment even
though they are able to convey their thoughts to the character. Honestly, dogs
speak kind of like the dogs from [u]Up![/u] and rats and cats are no better.
Most non-mammalian beasts are downright disappointing conversationalists (with
exceptions made for some wicked smart non-mammals like crows and octopuses).
Tongue of Beasts is passive and covert, and cannot be dispelled.</p>
<a class="header" href="#advanced-call-of-the-wild" id="advanced-call-of-the-wild"><h3>Advanced Call of the Wild</h3></a>
<p><strong>The Beckoning</strong> The character emits some suitably animalistic noise and calls
all creatures of a specific type to their location. The character can only
choose one type of animal at a time, and the power reaches out to 100 meters per
point of Potency. Using The Beckoning requires three power points and a Complex
Action. The number of beasts that come is dependent upon how many of the type of
creature that are within the area, and the urgency with which they come and the
degree of control the character has over their actions upon their arrival is
based on the number of hits achieved on a Strength + Survival or Charisma +
Empathy test. When dealing with large or predatory animals, the range of The
Beckoning increases to 500 meters per potency. When calling large predatory
animals, the range extends to 5 kilometers per point of potency.</p>
<p><strong>Transformation</strong> The character can transform a victim into a beast by spending
a power point and a complex action. This is a humiliating ordeal, and as the
target doubtless has little familiarity with their new form is generally quite
awkward and difficult for the victim (over and above being transformed into a
frog or pig). The character makes a Strength + Empathy or Willpower + Survival
test against the target's Intuition. The victim becomes a beast of the
character's choice until the next sunrise or sunset. Net hits increase the time
frame of a victim's transformation. This ability is a Protean power. A character
can't be transformed into an animal much larger than their original size, but
they can be transformed into something much smaller.</p>
<a class="header" href="#elder-call-of-the-wild" id="elder-call-of-the-wild"><h3>Elder Call of the Wild</h3></a>
<p><strong>Songs in the Dark</strong> The character can create horrible monsters out of ordinary
animals. By spending six power points, any mundane beast can be invested with
enough astral power as to be transformed into a monster. The investment takes an
hour and the transformation itself takes a day. The character makes a Charisma +
Survival or Willpower + Medicine test. Making a Behemoth is hard (Threshold 3),
while making a Chimera is crazy extreme (Threshold 5). The Giant Animal is
created under the character's loose control. A character can control a number of
such animals equal to their Willpower.</p>
<p><strong>Soul Investment</strong> The character can place a portion of their soul into another
being, and subsequently take the target's body over when the investing
character's current body goes unconscious or dies. The character must touch the
target for a Complex Action, spend two power points, and make an opposed
Willpower + Empathy or Strength + Survival test against the target's Willpower.
A character can have portions of their soul hidden in a number of creatures
equal to their Intuition, and they must choose only one of their victims to hop
to when the time comes. While controlling a body, use the Strength and Agility
of the host, but all other attributes and all skills of the character. The
character does not lose control of a host by <em>sleeping</em>, but they do
automatically hop again (losing their soul investment in that victim) if they
are actually knocked unconscious. The character never loses their effective Soul
Investment in their original body, but if they are ever forced to hop and there
are no living bodies with remaining Soul Investment, the character dies.</p>
<a class="header" href="#chasing-the-storm" id="chasing-the-storm"><h2>Chasing the Storm</h2></a>
<p><em>Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,<br />
And ye that on the sands with printless foot<br />
Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him<br />
When he comes back.</em></p>
<p>Chasing the Storm is the astral sorcery dedicated to understanding and
controlling the weather. A character with Chasing the Storm knows what the
weather should be for a week in advance (which means that they likewise know
when weather sorcery is employed), and they gain a +1 dicepool bonus on Survival
tests. With Advanced Chasing the Storm, a character knows the upcoming weather a
month in advance and gains a +2 bonus. With Elder Chasing the Storm, the
character's predictive capabilities extend for a year and a day and they gain a
+3 dicepool bonus on Survival.</p>
<a class="header" href="#basic-chasing-the-storm" id="basic-chasing-the-storm"><h3>Basic Chasing the Storm</h3></a>
<p><strong>Howling Winds</strong> The character can make winds rise or soften and blow in a
direction of their choice. The character can spend a complex action to make an
Agility + Rigging or Logic + Operations test to increase or decrease the
Strength of the winds by the number of hits.</p>
<p><strong>Rising Mists</strong> The character can fill areas with thickening fog that obscures
vision and makes things seem really spooky. By spending a Complex Action, the
character can fill up their immediate vicinity with mists, extending up to 3
meters per Potency from their person. By spending two power points, they can
create an actual weather pattern, with mists creeping in out to a kilometer per
Potency from their person. The character makes an Agility + Rigging or Logic +
Operations test to decrease visibility through the mists:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="center"> Hits </th><th align="left"> Distance to Total Concealment </th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="center"> 1 </td><td align="left"> 6 meters </td></tr>

</tbody></table>
<a class="header" href="#advanced-chasing-the-storm" id="advanced-chasing-the-storm"><h3>Advanced Chasing the Storm</h3></a>
<p><strong>Lightning Strike</strong> A cloudy sky can be split by a lightning bolt crashing to
Earth. By spending a complex action, the character can direct a lightning bolt
to strike an individual or object. The lightning bolt cannot be dodged, its
threshold to hit the target at any range is 2, and it is a Damage 5 weapon. It
is powered by an Agility + Rigging or Logic + Electronics test. Once unleashed,
the bolt of lightning is real electricity, and can be defended against with
conductive materials in classic Franklin or Tesla fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Tumultuous Rain</strong> The character can pull clouds into a clear sky and rain from
clouds. It takes a base amount of time of an hour to bring rain from a clear
sky, and net hits on an Agility + Rigging or Logic + Operations test can reduce
the timeframe. The more it is &quot;naturally&quot; clouded, the easier this is, and the
character gains a +2 bonus if there are already clouds <em>somewhere</em> in the sky,
raising to a +6 bonus if there is already some tiny amount of rain coming down.
The weather can be affected out to 5 kilometers per Potency of the character.
Once established, a weather pattern persists until natural forces blow it away.
This costs 3 power points.</p>
<a class="header" href="#elder-chasing-the-storm" id="elder-chasing-the-storm"><h3>Elder Chasing the Storm</h3></a>
<p><strong>Form of Mist</strong> The character can transform themselves into a fine mist as a
Free action by spending a power point. This is a Protean ability. While in mist
form, a character's body is essentially impervious to physical attacks, save
those that are made with a weapon that the character is vulnerable to.
Everything the character is carrying when they transform transforms with them,
and other creatures thus transformed are essentially helpless until the
character becomes solid again. While in mist form the character can fly, but
they move no faster than a normal walk. For purposes of being dispelled, Form of
Mist has 3 hits.</p>
<p><strong>Victory of Typhon</strong> By spending eight power points, the character can create a
&quot;tropical depression&quot; at their location; and subsequently direct its progress.
This requires an hour and a power point. The character makes an Agility +
Rigging or Logic + Operations test, and the massive storm takes form and is
unleashed in a direction of the character's choosing. Creating a Tropical Storm
is a Professional Task (threshold 2), creating a Category 2 Hurricane is Crazy
Extreme (threshold 4), and creating a Category 4 Hurricane is threshold 6.
Remember that your storm may in fact be called a Typhoon or a Cyclone, depending
upon its ocean of origin.</p>
<a class="header" href="#coil-of-thorns" id="coil-of-thorns"><h2>Coil of Thorns</h2></a>
<p><em>Leaves drop in Autumn not because of the shortening of the day, but because of the lengthening of the night.</em></p>
<p>The Coil of Thorns is the Astral Sorcery dedicated to understanding and
manipulating plant life. Characters who practice this magic are able to do much
with practically any plant matter. The character's Artisan and Expression skills
gain a +2 bonus when working in primarily plant matter media. This bonus
increases to +4 with knowledge of Advanced Col of Thorns, and to +6 with Elder
Coil of Thorns. Characters with Coil of Thorns can also make something edible
and even delicious out of literally any plant matter. It's not at all obvious
how it's done, but their redwood pasta is not bad at all. This magic is
inextricably linked in the minds of many supernaturals with the Evil Plants, and
indeed any practitioner can speak with Evil Plants of any kind. It has even been
suggested that Dryad Witches are actually Pod spies. Most Coil spells are quite
powerful but quite time consuming to use. A Coil of Thorns laboratory is called
a &quot;Kitchen&quot; and can indeed be created with materials purchasable at a farmer's
market.</p>
<a class="header" href="#basic-coil-of-thorns" id="basic-coil-of-thorns"><h3>Basic Coil of Thorns</h3></a>
<p><strong>Bitter Fruit</strong> The character can make powerful medicines and poisons out of
ordinary fruits and roots. By spending a power point and an hour working in a
kitchen, the character's result can be a balm or a curse to those who consume it
with a strength equal to the number of hits on a Logic + Medicine or Intuition +
Survival test. Such products can be made into clearly medicinal pastes and the
like, or covertly disguised as fresh foods such as shiny apples. Doses with
other effects can also be produced, but if the requisite number of hits is not
achieved the resulting product is merely a standard damaging poison with a
strength equal to the actual hits achieved. With Advanced and Elder Coil of
Thorns comes the learning of additional recipes such as making powerful acids,
paralytics, or explosives. The seed that transforms a Luminary into a Dryad has
a threshold of 6 to brew.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left"> Hits </th><th> Poison </th><th> Effect </th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="center"> 1 </td><td align="left"> Anti-toxin </td><td align="left"> Reduces the power of toxins by its hits. </td></tr>

</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Grass Rope</strong> The character can have plant matter grow at tremendous speed
according to their will and grasp their enemies with wooden fastness. The
character spends a Complex Action and makes a Logic + Rigging or Intuition +
Survival test, and the leafy strands lash out with a Strength and Agility equal
to the number of hits.</p>
<a class="header" href="#advanced-coil-of-thorns" id="advanced-coil-of-thorns"><h3>Advanced Coil of Thorns</h3></a>
<p><strong>Mind Root</strong> The character plants a seed in a victim that slowly roots into the
unfortunate's brain and leaves them an emotionless pawn. Creating the Mind Root
takes four power points and an hour in the kitchen, and it takes an hour or two
for the tendrils to work their way into the victim (making it essentially
worthless against a target that is not willing, bound, or sleeping). The Mind
Root uses the character's Logic + Medicine or Intuition + Survival against the
victim's Strength.</p>
<p><strong>Puppetry</strong> The character can command plants to perform actions and have the
plants actually perform them at a reasonable speed. By spending a Complex
action, the character's plant minions will move about with distinctly
non-plantlike mobility for one round - attaining an effective Agility equal to
the character's Intuition or Logic. The character can also give long term
commands to plants, which they will go about performing at their normal speeds
(often centimeters a day). Commanding sapient (and presumably evil) plants is
more difficult, and requires the character to best them in Logic + Medicine or
Logic + Rigging against their Willpower to control one of them for a number of
rounds equal to the number of net hits. Otherwise Puppetry extends to any number
of plants within 10 meters of the character per point of Potency.</p>
<a class="header" href="#elder-coil-of-thorns" id="elder-coil-of-thorns"><h3>Elder Coil of Thorns</h3></a>
<p><strong>Abomination</strong> The character can work in a kitchen for an hour and spend seven
power points to grow an Evil Plant from inert plant material and evil magic. The
product is a harmless if strange looking potted plant that will grow into a
horror over the following night. The character makes a Logic + Medicine or
Intuition + Survival test to get the process started. Making a Man Trap is
threshold 3, making a Triffid is threshold 5, and making a Pod is threshold 7.
Creating these abominations bestows no special ability to control them.</p>
<p><strong>Seeds of Destruction</strong> Time destroys all things according to mortals, but even
amongst supernaturals it is known that the work of your hands will eventually be
claimed by the legacy of nature. Using this ability, the character accelerates
this process, causing the progression of seasons and flora to rip things to
shreds. Roots shatter stone and flesh alike and tiny pieces blow away in pollen
laden dust. This is a damage 3 attack that assaults each target in a cone that
is up to 100 meters in length per point of Potency. No inanimate object is
treated as larger than small, as bigger things are torn apart from every
direction and even the inside. Targets are attacked from inside themselves, so
the range is considered Adjacent regardless of physical distance. The character
must spend a Complex Action and a power point, and uses Logic + Rigging or
Intuition + Survival, increasing damage with hits. This power can be used on a
much smaller scale without spending a power point, but it only projects 2 meters
per point of Potency.</p>
<a class="header" href="#trail-of-tears" id="trail-of-tears"><h2>Trail of Tears</h2></a>
<p><em>Bitterest of all is not the sorrow but to have one's sorrows ignored.</em></p>
<p>The Trail of Tears is a magical discipline which harvests the power of misery.
In the Deep Astral there is a liquid that is literally created by the fact that
sadness exists. This material is called the Tears of Maya, even though in a very
real way it is the psychic residue of human sorrow from the Material World.
Those who follow the Trail are incredibly good at finding the clouds in life.
They gain a +2 bonus to argue against any proposal, fact, or course of action.
At Advanced, this negativity increases to +4, and at Elder the ability to speak
against things rises to a full +6 bonus.</p>
<a class="header" href="#basic-trail-of-tears" id="basic-trail-of-tears"><h3>Basic Trail of Tears</h3></a>
<p><strong>Curse of Failure</strong> Using astral sorcery, the character curses a victim to have
luck abandon them at a later date. If the character succeeds on an opposed
Willpower + Sabotage or Willpower + Rigging check that takes a Simple Action,
evil magic hangs like a dark cloud of misery over the target's head. At any
later date, the character may reactively end this curse to force the victim to
reroll all hits on a test. The Curse of Failure is totally covert, all the
character actually does is look at the victim funny and the sorcery has no overt
special effects (although it can be detected as normal Astral magic).</p>
<p><strong>Pain Drops</strong> Tiny drops fall at the target, dampening not their skin but their
pride. The character spends a Simple Action to direct Tears of Maya to fall at a
target, and makes an Agility + Combat or Willpower + Rigging test to make a
standard ranged attack. Pain Drops have a damage rating equal to the character's
Willpower, and are soaked with Willpower rather than Strength. Pain Drops cause
only illusory damage, and while they cause wound penalties and even
incapacitation, they do not actually kill or wrap around into lethal damage.
Virtual damage from Pain Drops fades in an hour.</p>
<a class="header" href="#advanced-trail-of-tears" id="advanced-trail-of-tears"><h3>Advanced Trail of Tears</h3></a>
<p><strong>Dark Night of the Soul</strong> By spending a Complex Action belittling the target,
the character can provoke a Despair Frenzy in them. The character makes an
opposed Willpower + Sabotage or Willpower + Intimidate test against the target's
Willpower, and if successful the victim enters an immediate Despair Frenzy
(regardless of their Master Passion, if any). This ability is largely covert, as
it does not appear that the character did anything other than behave in a rude
and perhaps senselessly cruel fashion towards the victim.</p>
<p><strong>Water Prison</strong> With a Complex Action and a power point, water can be
manipulated into three dimensional shapes that hold their form and are strong as
steel. Actually capturing someone with the titular prison made of water requires
a ranged combat test using Agility + Combat or Willpower + Rigging. Grasping
water has a Strength equal to the character's Willpower.</p>
<a class="header" href="#elder-trail-of-tears" id="elder-trail-of-tears"><h3>Elder Trail of Tears</h3></a>
<p><strong>Astral Projection</strong> Activating Astral Projection sends a character and
possibly their friends into the deep or shallow Dreamlands or back to the
material world. Anything the character carries as well as a circle of hand
holding creatures up to the character's Willpower in number (and everything
<em>they</em> are carrying as well) shifts across the worlds with the character. Astral
Projection requires a Complex Action and a power point. For purposes of
dispelling, Astral Projection has 3 hits.</p>
<p><strong>Object of Envy</strong> The character can reach into a target's mind and create some
physical thing that the target deeply desires. This can be something as simple
as a sandwich or as complex as a whole person. This costs seven power points
regardless of how elaborate or abstractly valuable it is. Electronics created in
this way don't function super well because they are made out of evil magic even
more so than a modern operating system normally is. A person created in this way
is always an Extra with no edge stat or supernatural powers. They are otherwise
able to pass as the actual person they are based upon (if any), though they are
preternaturally disposed towards evil and cruelty and are under the control of
the character who made them. The character makes a Charisma + Expression test to
set the quality of the mimicry of a person; a Logic + Electronics test to set
the quality of created electronics; and an Intuition + Artisan test to set the
quality of most other things. An Object of Envy so exactly duplicates a desired
thing that it can set off a Greed or Loneliness frenzy in the target from whom
the desire was plucked (in general, the number of hits on the ability generates
the threshold to resist the frenzy). A targeted creature can try to keep their
desires to themselves, making a Willpower + Sabotage test as a reactive action -
if the target gets at least as many hits as the character, the Object of Envy
never takes form. When an Object of Envy is destroyed, it reverts into tears.
Creating an Object of Envy takes a minute.</p>
<a class="header" href="#veil-of-morpheus" id="veil-of-morpheus"><h2>Veil of Morpheus</h2></a>
<p><em>When you dream, dream of me.</em></p>
<p>The veil between the waking world and the world of sleep is both vast and
unfathomable. And yet to those who scry deeply into Maya can see past it, and in
time they learn to reach across and pull things from one side to the other. A
character who practices the Veil of Morpheus is able to perceive objects and
creatures in the Shallow Dreamlands, though not to touch them and is in no
danger from them physically. With Advanced Veil of Morpheus, the character can
perceive their own surroundings while they are asleep, and are able to wake
themselves at will. And when a character has Elder Veil of Morpheus, they know
inherently when creatures are dreaming within a kilometer of themselves. Note
that in a city, they will often be aware of a <em>lot</em> of sleepers.</p>
<a class="header" href="#basic-veil-of-morpheus" id="basic-veil-of-morpheus"><h3>Basic Veil of Morpheus</h3></a>
<p><strong>Enchanted Slumber</strong> Using astral sorceries the character makes people
supernaturally sleepy. The compulsion to sleep is virtually impossible to
overcome for people who are already asleep, and is at best a minor inconvenience
for those whose adrenaline is pumping. Activating it is potentially covert, in
that the target is not especially aware of anything other than a feeling of
sleepiness. The character however produces faintly glowing dust from their hands
when used, and expends a Complex Action doing it. Using Enchanted Slumber
requires an opposed Charisma + Expression or Logic + Medicine vs. Intuition
test. An affected target that is already asleep will not awaken for at least an
hour (longer with net hits) even in the face of loud noises or shaking. An
affected target who is not asleep will go to sleep at the first opportunity and
then stay asleep for at least an hour (longer with net hits).</p>
<p><strong>Dream Vision</strong> The character can send messages and images into the dreams of
another creature. The dream visions can go an unlimited distance. The character
must know the name of the intended recipients, the targets must all be asleep
and the character needs to meditate on the sending. The base timeframe to send
visions is an hour, but net hits on a Charisma + Expression or Logic + Research
test can reduce that.</p>
<a class="header" href="#advanced-veil-of-morpheus" id="advanced-veil-of-morpheus"><h3>Advanced Veil of Morpheus</h3></a>
<p><strong>Denial of Privacy</strong> The character views into the dreams of a sleeping target.
The character spends a Complex Action attuning themselves to the dreams of a
target. The target must be asleep and within 100 meters per hit on a Charisma +
Empathy or Logic + Medicine test. While so attuned, the character can make
themselves appear in the dream or simply voyeuristicly  watch the proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>Horrid Reality</strong> The stuff of dreams becomes the stuff of reality. The
character spends a Complex Action and suddenly the physical effects of events
that take place within a dreamer's dream reality draw their toll on their body.
While the effects of a sexy or merely surreal dream may not even be immediately
obvious upon waking, the effects of a nightmare can be catastrophically fatal.
The character need only know the name of a potential victim and their location
while dreaming, the ability works at any distance. The victim can fight back
against the invader with whatever is in their dream, but unless they <em>also</em> have
Horrid Reality, the only thing they will get from defeating their attacker is to
knock them out of their dream until the following sunset. For purposes of
dispelling, Horrid Reality has 3 hits.</p>
<a class="header" href="#elder-veil-of-morpheus" id="elder-veil-of-morpheus"><h3>Elder Veil of Morpheus</h3></a>
<p><strong>Dreamscape</strong> The character shapes the Deep Dreamlands to be as they want it to
be. The character spends an Edge and the dreamlands of Maya begin to adjust
themselves to the substance and reality that the character wishes them to
contain. This transformation takes a base amount of time of one day, but they
can make a Charisma + Expression or Logic + Operations test, and reduce the
timeframe with net hits. Things created in the dreamlands are like Hollywood
sets. While an object might glitter like gold, it's just a prop.</p>
<p><strong>Dreamstep</strong> The character can move seamlessly between the Shallow Dreamlands
and the Material World at will. Crossing the threshold between the Shallow Maya
and the physical world is a Simple Action and the character can take anything
they can carry with them. For purposes of dispelling, Dreamstep has 3 hits.</p>
