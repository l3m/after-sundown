## Zombies
_"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains."_

Zombies are physical bodies without the benefit of life or human spirit who nonetheless move about and hunger for the brains of the living. They are not respected members of the supernatural community, but are instead treated as servitors and disposable soldiers by those with necromantic powers and a social problem by most everyone else. Zombies are not traditionally considered playable, but are instead most likely to appear as tools or independent menaces in an After Sundown campaign.

All Zombies, regardless of strength have an Orphic power source. When an extra becomes a Zombie, they become a Shambler or a Soulless depending upon the circumstances of their transformation. When a Luminary becomes a Zombie, they become a Revenant in all cases. Unlike many unplayable types, a Zombie _is_ made out of a human being and they _are_ templated onto a normal human statline.

### Shamblers
_"When the dead rise, civilization will fall."_

Shamblers are the classic "slow zombies" from zombie movies from the eighties. They hunger for brains, but they are basically walking corpses who shamble around - hence the name. Shamblers are _not_ individually particularly dangerous. But they _are_ implacable and they can come in fairly large numbers. Created by Orphic sorcery or by leakage of power from Mictlan, Shamblers will thoughtlessly move toward humans and attempt to eat their brains. The opening up of a major Well to Mictlan is often accompanied by the mass animation of large numbers of corpses as Shamblers, leading to potentially terrifying armies of the things even in the face of the relative incompetence of any solitary Shambler.

A Shambler has no Charisma or Logic score and automatically fails any test it would be called upon to make. Upon creation, a Shambler's Agility is reduced by one (to a minimum of 1), and their Strength is increased by 1. A Shambler loses all of their skills, even combat skills. When not controlled magically, they really will simply walk over and relentlessly and unskillfully claw and bite at potential victims with their substantial but undirected strength. Shamblers are not specifically slower than a normal person, but they _always_ move at the rate of a Careful Walk even when ordered to do otherwise. Only their literally endless endurance and willingness to travel unceasingly to find brains gives their aggregate daily travels a frightening total of up to 50 kilometers a day. 

Shamblers do not actually spread zombification, but they are often accompanied by evil magic that will reanimate all the corpses in the area, which will include their victims. The skin of a Shambler is quite resilient and hard, and their fists are Damage 1N weapons. Shamblers have no passions.

A Shambler has an Orphic power source but no power schedule, Potency, or Power attribute.

### Soulless
_"If you look at the whole life of the planet, we... you know, man, has only been around for a few blinks of an eye. So if the infection wipes us all out, that is a return to normality."_

The Soulless are the lately fashionable "fast zombies" of more modern cinema such as 28 Days Later and the Dawn of the Dead remake. Clearly distinct from Shamblers by their bright red eyes and relatively speedy disposition, the Soulless are neither plodding nor tireless. Possessed of more humanlike speeds and faculties, the Soulless are individually much more terrifying than a Shambler. But while they are rarely spawned in the tremendous numbers of Shamblers, the fact that they can and do spread their affliction readily to the living means that their numbers can easily grow out of control if not checked by heroic intervention.

A Soulless loses their Charisma but not their Logic. Their Strength is increased by 1, but their Agility is unaffected. A Soulless is consumed by rage at all times to the point of complete irrationality, but they are not actually incapable of utilizing tools. While a Soulless will _usually_ opt to empower Vigor to tear down a door rather than attempting to turn the knob, this is a result of their all consuming hatred rather than actual ineptitude on their part. The bite or even _spit_ of the Soulless can corrupt and kill mortals, and the venom they are equipped with from their serpent's tongue ability is always a fatal one. The Soulless fighting style is simple and predictable, but usually effective enough. All Soulless have a Combat skill of 1.

Soulless, like Shamblers, have no special power to transform others into Zombies of any kind, but are often carriers of the Rage Virus which does. If they are sterilized by any method, any victims they take down will stay inert. Every Soulless is dominated by Master Passion Rage and will fly into a Rage Frenzy with basically no provocation at all. Triggers include _seeing humans_.

A Soulless has an Orphic power source and a Lunar power schedule.

#### Soulless Starting Powers

Basic Powers

* Vigor (Basic Clout)
* Nimble Feet (Basic Celerity)
* Bite of the Serpent (Basic Lure of Destruction)


### Revenants
_"The Living Dead and the dying living are all the same. Cut from the same cloth. But disposing of dead people is a public service, whereas you're in all sorts of trouble if you kill someone while they're still alive."_

The Revenant is the talkative wight from virtually every piece of fiction where a Zombie is a major character. Whether the lovely and sensual She from [Cemetery Man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109592/), the creepy Shelly Winters from [Scary Go Round](http://www.scarygoround.com/sgr/ar.php?date=20020604) or the villainous Dark Ash and Sheila from [Army of Darkness](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106308/), _every_ Luminary who becomes a Zombie by _whatever_ means becomes a Revenant. Revenancy is curable, as can be plainly seen from both _Scary Go Round_ and _Army of Darkness_, and it is the only form of Zombieness that is. A Revenant appears much as it did in life, save for pale white skin and darkness around the eyes. Basically they look like someone who is wearing heavy goth makeup, save that there is something _obviously_ unnatural about them that even the most casual observer can plainly see.

Revenants do not necessarily lose their reasoning faculties nor their personal moral compass. However, they _do_ hunger for the brains of the living, and are doomed to gradually weaken and lose power until they devour such. Eating the brain of a human refreshes their Power batteries, but they _don't_ have an unobtrusive or Vow of Silence upholding alternative at their disposal. Sooner or later, they _will_ be compelled to break open a human skull and feast on the morsels inside. It is for this reason that even the usually quite open minded supernatural societies generally want Revenants cured or destroyed - their mere presence endangers the kindred more than most Syndicates are willing to condone.

A Revenant has their Strength, Intuition, and Willpower all increased by 1. Every Revenant is subject to Master Passion Hunger. Every Revenant carries the Z-Virus with their Abyss of the Body.

A Revenant has an Orphic power source and a Feeding power schedule.
